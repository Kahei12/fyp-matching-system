1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The  Final  Year  Project  (FYP)  is  a  cornerstone  of  the  Electronic  and  Computer  Engineering  
program in Hong Kong Metropolitan University. It is a two-term, 10-credit course designed to 
equip students with the ability to carry out an effective research or development project on their 
own. Even in other university or other subject, students are also required   to finish their FYP to 
conclude what they learnt in their main subject. A crucial and often complicated aspect of this 
exercise is the allocation of projects to supervisors and students. Before student start to process 
their work,  they should first propose or choose a related topic of their main subject for their 
FYP.  It  is  a  three-stage  system:  Proposal,  Matching,  and  Clearing.  While  it  functions,  this  
process heavily employs manual coordination, dispersed communication (e.g. using email and 
forms), and lacks a central decision-making platform with transparency in real-time. 
 
This manual approach presents several significant challenges that hinder efficiency, fairness, 
and the overall user experience for all stakeholders involved:   
1. Lack of Transparency: Students have limited visibility into which projects are popular 
or which supervisors are in high demand before making their selections. Most of the 
student have no experience about their FYP topic and may not be familiar with the 
professors  proposing  the  topics.  Consequently,  they  are  often  forced  to  make  this  
crucial choice based solely on a brief project description, without contextual data that 
could inform a better decision. 
 
2. Inefficiency  for  Administrators:  Inefficiency  for  Administrators:  Managing  student  
preferences, calculating matches based on GPA and stated interests,  and  processing  
the clearing stage for unmatched students manually is naturally time-consuming and 
prone  to  human  mistake.  Even  if  certain  components  of  matching  are  mechanized  
under  the  existing  system,  administrators  are  still  faced  with  the  inconvenience  of 
handling special cases, exceptions, and the overall coordination, which continues to 
be a burdensome administrative task. 
 
 
3. Limited Visibility for Supervisors: The "big picture" is not easily visible to teachers. 
They  lack  insight  into  how  their  projects  are  relatively  more  or  less  popular  than  
others,  which  would  provide  valuable  feedback  to  influence  subsequent  project  

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 4 
design.  Another  significantly  reported  issue  is  the  "silo  effect";  when  supervisors  
submit  official  and  present  their  project  titles,  they  lack  a  systematic  way  of  seeing  
what  other  faculty  members  are  proposing.  This  have  the  tendency  to  lead  to  
imbalance project  difficulty  and  scope,  and  in  some  instances  even  replication  or  
duplication of project ideas, ultimately reducing the diversity and balance of available 
alternatives for students. 
 
4. Delayed and Opaque Communication: Students and teachers may not be aware of their 
assignment  status  or  the  overall  progress  of  the  allocation  process  until  the  final  
announcement. Students and teachers are kept in the dark regarding their assignment 
status  and  the  overall  progress  until  the  final  announcement.  This  prolonged  
uncertainty   prevents   effective   planning,   fosters   anxiety,   and   eliminates   any   
opportunity  for  proactive  issue  resolution,  ultimately  concentrating  pressure  and  
potential disputes at the single point of the final result release. 
 
 
 
1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES 
 
The overarching aim of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a comprehensive, web-
based  FYP  Matching  System.  This  system  will  serve  as  a  centralized  digital  platform  to  
automate, streamline, and bring transparency to the entire Final Year Project allocation process. 
It seeks to replace the current fragmented and manual approach, thereby enhancing efficiency, 
fairness,  and  the  overall  experience  for  students,  academic  supervisors,  and  administrative  
staff.  It would be a well-developed FYP matching system that improve the efficiency of the 
matching period. 
 
1.1.1 REVISED OBJECTIVES BASED ON IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS 
 
While  the  overarching  aim  of  this  project  remains  to  design,  develop,  and  deploy  a  
comprehensive web-based FYP Matching System, the implementation progress to date allows 
the original objectives to be refined and reported with clearer status indicators. 
 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 5 
With  that  aim  in  mind,  The  project  is  organized into  the  following  specific,  measurable  
objectives:  
 
1. To Develop a Centralized and Role-Based Web Application 
To create a single, unified web portal accessible to all stakeholders. The system will 
feature three distinct user interfaces tailored to the needs of Students, Supervisors, and 
Administrators, ensuring that everyone can easily find what they need for their job. 
 
2. To Implement a Robust and Transparent Matching Algorithm 
To  engineer  a  core  matching  algorithm  that  automates  project  allocation. It  mainly  
looks at the project choices students list in order of preference. If more than one student 
wants  the  same  project,  GPA  will  be  used  to  decide  who  gets  it.  This  keeps  things  
objective and fair for everyone. 
 
3. To Enhance Decision-Making with Real-Time Data Analytics 
To integrate data visualization features that provide real-time insights. Students will be 
able to see how popular projects are (like how many times a project has been picked) 
to help them choose wisely. Supervisors will get a bird's-eye view of all the available 
projects. This will lead to better teamwork and make sure all projects are well-designed.  
 
4. To Streamline Administrative Workflow and Management 
To build a solid admin system that handles key tasks automatically. It takes care of user 
accounts, manages project deadlines, starts the matching process, keeps an eye on what 
happens,  and  deals  with  students  who  don’t  get  matched.  This  cuts  down  on  manual 
work and mistakes. 
 
5. To Ensure System Reliability and Usability 
To ensure the final product is not only functional but also robust and user-friendly. That 
is, rigorous testing to provide system stability at maximum load (e.g., deadline time) 
and  designing  an  easy-to-use  interface [9] that  requires  minimal  training  for  all  user  
types, thereby encouraging high levels of adoption.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
The  development  of  a  modern  web  application  like  the  FYP  Matching  System  requires  a  
properly  chosen  set  of  technologies  for  the  database,  the  backend,  and  the  frontend.  The  
selected  stack,  the  MERN  stack  (MongoDB,  Express.js,  React,  Node.js)  [3,  6],  was  chosen  
after  considering  alternatives  on  the  basis  of  suitability  to  the  project  requirements  of  
flexibility, performance, and efficiency of development. 
 
2.1 TECHNOLOGY STACK SELECTION AND JUSTIFICATION 
2.1.1 MongoDB: The NoSQL Database 
 
MongoDB  is  a  document  database  used  to  build  highly  available  and  scalable  internet  
applications. [7] With its flexible schema approach, it’s popular with development teams using 
agile methodologies. Offering drivers for all major programming languages, MongoDB allows 
you  to  immediately  start  building  your  application  without  spending  time  configuring  a  
database. Why MongoDB is being used but not other database system? This document model 
works great for the FYP system's data [13]. A Project document can hold all the details like 
title, description, and supervisor. A Student document can list their project preferences. The 
schema is flexible, so it’s easy to make adjustments as build. Plus, its JSON structure fits right 
in with the JavaScript backend and frontend, which makes data exchange simple. 
 
2.1.2 Node.js & Express.js: The Backend Foundation 
 
Node.js   is   a   cross-platform,   open-source   JavaScript   runtime   environment   that   allows   
developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. [8] Traditionally, JavaScript 
was  limited  to  client-side  web  development  within  browsers,  but  Node.js  extends  its  
capabilities to server-side and network applications. Express.js (or simply Express) is the most 
popular Node.js web application framework, designed for building web applications and APIs 
[2]. It's often called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. It also provides a thin 
layer of fundamental web application features without obscuring Node.js features. Node.js and 
Ecprewss.js  over  options  like  Django  or  Spring  Boot  mainly  because  it  lets  us  stick  to  one  
language,  JavaScript,  for  everything [1].  Both  the  front  end  and  back  end.  This  makes  
development smoother, since developers don't have to switch between languages as much, and 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 9 
it's easier to share code. Node.js also handles a lot of connections at once really well, which is 
super important when everyone's trying to submit preferences at the same time. 
 
2.1.3 React: The Frontend Library 
 
React  (also  known  as  React.  js  or  ReactJS)  is a  free  and  open-source  front-end  JavaScript  
library [10] that aims to make building user interfaces based on components more "seamless". 
It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and 
companies.  React  is  picked  over  other  options  like  Vue.js  and  Angular  because  its  reusable  
components let us build interfaces for Students, Teachers, and Admins that are consistent but 
still unique. [14] Moreover, React's Virtual DOM makes sure the user experience is quick and 
fluid,  which  is  key  for  showing  stuff  that  changes  a  lot,  like  live  popularity  numbers.  Also,  
React is easier to learn and more flexible than a complete framework like Angular. 
 
2.2 ANALYSIS OF EXISTING AND ALTERNATIVE ALLOCATION SYSTEMS 
 
This section analyzes the current HKMU system and compares it to other common automated 
allocation systems. By checking out these options, a better picture can be created and explained 
why I designed the new system the way I did. The goal is to keep what's good about the current 
way of doing things, fix what's not working, and add in good stuff from other systems that have 
already been proven to work well. 
 
2.2.1 The Current HKMU System: A Batch-Processing "Black Box" 
 
The existing allocation process at HKMU is formally structured into three distinct phases, as 
stated in the student handbook. However, from a user experience and technological perspective, 
each phase is characterized by a lack of integration and transparency. 
 
1. Proposal Phase：In this initial stage, supervisors propose their project titles. However， 
they  don't  have  a  central  place  to  see  what  other  faculty  members  are  working  on.  
Because of this, projects might not be consistent in difficulty and might even cover the 
same ground. 
2. Matching Phase：This is where the automated part really kicks in, but it's also the least 
clear. Students look at a project list and rank their choices using a simple form, like a 
Google Form. Once the time is up, the system uses a secret matching process. It looks 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 10 
at student preferences and GPAs, but no one knows exactly how it works or gets updates 
as it goes. Neither students nor supervisors can see what's happening. 
3. Clearing Phase：For students who are not matched with any of their preferred projects 
in  the  Matching  Phase,  the  system  enters  a  clearing  phase.  But,  this  part  needs  help  
from the administrator to put students into available spots. It's not always clear how this 
works, and students don't get to see what's happening, which can be stressful. 
 
Advantage：The  three-phase  setup  makes  the  admin  side  straightforward.  Additionally,  the  
automation in the Matching Phase makes things easier than doing it all by hand. 
 
Disadvantage：The biggest problem with the system is that it isn't clear or connected. Each of 
the  three  parts  “Proposals”,  “Matching”,  and  “Clearing”  works  on  its  own.  Because  people  
have  to  use  different  tools  for  each  part,  it's  hard  to  plan  ahead.  This  also  makes  everyone  
worried and unsure if they can trust the system. 
 
2.2.2 Considered and Rejected: The First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) Model 
 
Automating a first-come, first-served system to make things better, but I decided against it. An 
FCFS system gives feedback right away and is easy to set up, but it's not really fair. It puts too 
much importance on connection speed instead of things like a student's abilities or if they're a 
good fit for a project. Since this idea is fair in school, It was a good choice for the system. 
 
2.2.3 Considered and Adapted: Principles from Stable Matching Algorithms 
 
Using standard matching methods from computer science, like the Gale-Shapley algorithm [4], 
which is  developed by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley, finds a stable matching between two 
groups by having one group propose to the other based on preference lists. But these methods 
are too complicated and not easy for people to understand. Plus, they need everyone to submit 
complete lists of what they want, which is not doable here. 
 
So, my system doesn't use a complex matching method directly. Instead, it takes the main idea 
"respecting ranked choices" from stable matching theory [11] and makes it simpler.  The system 
uses a clear, rule-based method that focuses on the order of preferences and uses GPA to break 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 11 
ties. This way, it’s fair and easy for everyone to understand, balancing correctness with being 
user-friendly. 
 
2.2.4 Comparative Analysis and Positioning of the Proposed Solution 
 
After reviewing the current system and other options, a clear design goals is set for the FYP 
Matching System. It needs to keep the current HKMU system's batch-processing speed after 
the deadline, but also make it much easier to understand and use, since it's not very clear or 
connected right now. Here's a quick comparison of what I am aiming for. 
 
Aspect Current HKMU System Proposed FYP Matching System 
Transparency  "Black-box" 
model. Undisclosed matching 
logic.
 
"Glass-box" model. Clear, rules-
based algorithm (Preferences + 
GPA).
 
Supervisor Insight Siloed view. No visibility into 
other projects. 
Holistic dashboard. Ability to view 
and compare all projects. 
Student Decision-Making Blind submission. No data on 
popularity or competition. 
Informed strategy. Real-time 
popularity statistics for projects. 
User Experience Fragmented workflow. Relies 
on separate, generic tools. 
Unified platform. A single, 
integrated web application for all 
tasks. 
Communication  Prolonged uncertainty. 
Status unknown until final 
release. 
Process visibility. Clear indications 
of the current phase and status. 
Table 2 
To summarize, the FYP Matching System aims to fix the key problems with the current HKMU 
system. It brings an innovative method that emphasizes transparency, gives users more control, 
and focuses on their needs. At the same time, it keeps the current system's fair, batch-processing 
method and avoids the downsides of simpler or overly complicated models like FCFS and pure 
stable matching.

3. METHODOLOGY 
 
This section  describes  the  conceptual  and  procedural  aspects  of  the  system,  its  basic  needs  
which were the subject of the earlier chapter and the system interface sketches implemented 
here. The HKMU FYP Matching System of this study features a role-based interface design 
with   three   separate   user   portals,   following   a   clear   three-tier   architecture [5].   The 
implementation of each interface is carefully planned to address the requirements of the various 
user roles of the Final Year Project environment. 
 
3.1 SYSTEM INTERFACE DESIGN AND WORKFLOW 
3.1.1 Authentication Interface 
Figure 1 (login page) 
 
In  figure  1,  the  system  has  a  unified  access  point  for  students, teachers,  and  administrator. 
When you login, there are spots for your email and password to show you what to type. One 
neat thing it does is figure out your character by looking at your email. Then, it sends you to 
the right place after you log in. There is also a sign-up link for students and teachers who don’t 
have their account yet. 
 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 13 
3.1.2 Student Portal Interface 
Figure 2 (student account, propose phase) 
 
In figure 2, students can find a detailed proposal form where they need to fill in their project 
title, description, and the tech skills needed. The system will show their profile information, 
like  name,  email,  GPA,  student  ID,  and  major.  The  form  is  easy  to  use  with  examples  and  
straightforward ways to submit. 
Figure 3 (student account, matching phase) 
 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 14 
In figure 3, students can check out projects through a live interface that shows how popular 
each one is at that moment. The table lists project names, supervisors, how many students have 
picked  them,  and  an  Add  Preference  button.  Students  can  rank  projects  by  dragging  and  
dropping them into their preferred order, and the system shows which ones they have already 
chosen. 
Figure 4 (student account, result) 
 
After  the  matching  process,  it  turns  to  result  part  just  shown  as  figure  4. Students  get  
assignment  results  that  show  their  project,  supervisor,  match  type  ((like  1st  Preference)  and 
contact details. The system also shows matching stats (for example, 38 of 45 projects were a 
successful match) and links to helpful resources, such as popular supervisors and category stats. 
 
Figure 5 (student account, popular supervisors) 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 15 
 
 
Figure 6 (student account, categories) 
 
Figure 5 and 6 show how students can view supervisor rankings by project count and selections, 
plus category popularity stats. This information, along with selection tips, helps students pick 
projects that match their interests and have a decent chance of getting chosen. 
3.1.3
 （APPLICATION MANAGEMENT INTERFACE） 
 
 
Figure 7 (teacher account, project management) 
 
Supervisors see a dashboard with their projects and applicant lists as shown as figure 7. They 
can view student applicants, along with their GPAs and preference rankings, which helps them 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 16 
make good selection choices. Each project section organizes applicant info clearly using visual 
layout. 
 
 
Figure 8 (teacher account, student application) 
 
Teachers are able to see their assigned students, along with their GPA, department, and contact 
info  as  shown  as  figure  8.  The  system  has  tools  to  manage  schedules  and  set  up  meetings,  
which helps with project guidance during the school year. 
 
 
Figure 9 (teacher account, supervision list) 
 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 17 
The Supervision List page shows the final list of students each teacher is assigned to for the 
school year (like 2024-2025) as shown as figure 9. You'll see a simple list with each student's 
full details: name, project title, GPA, department, and email. It's the go-to spot for managing 
supervisions and usually includes handy tools like a Schedule Meeting button to help teachers 
keep in touch and track how their students are doing on projects. 
 
3.1.4 Admin Portal Interfaces 
 
 
 
Figure 10 (admin account, project review) 
 
Admins can see projects that need approval on the review dashboard as shown as figure 10. 
For  each  project,  they'll  find  details,  required  skills,  and  options  to  approve,  reject,  or  add  
comments. A progress bar shows how the review process is going, like 25 out of 45 projects 
reviewed, 56% done. 
 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 18 
 
Figure 11 (admin account, matching control) 
 
The  admin  matching  dashboard  features  phase  management  with  start/end  timestamps,  live  
statistics (e.g., 150 students, 143 preferences submitted), and algorithm control mechanisms as 
shown  as  figure  11.  The  interface  includes  advanced  settings  and  estimated  completion  
forecasting for comprehensive matching oversight. 
 
 
Figure 12 (admin account, final assignment) 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 19 
 
If there are students who don't get matched automatically, administrators can easily put them 
into open projects by hand. The system shows a list of students who still need a project (like 7 
students, for example), along with their GPA and the projects that are still available as shown 
as figure 12. This helps make sure everyone gets a fair placement, even if the automatic system 
doesn't work for them. 
 
 
Figure 13 (admin account, deadline management) 
 
Admins can control deadlines across the whole system, setting and changing important phase 
timelines  with  automated  alerts  as  shown  as  figure  13.  The  interface  handles  the  proposal,  
matching,  and  project  management  stages,  keeping  academic  calendars  and  communication  
guidelines in mind. 
 
3.2 S
YSTEM WORKFLOW SUMMARY 
 
Phase 1: Proposal and Review 
Students submit project proposals, and administrators check and sign off on project lists. The 
system  keeps  the  review  process  in  order  and  makes  sure  progress  is  tracked  and  quality  is  
maintained. 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 20 
 
Phase 2: Preference-Based Matching 
Students look through the projects, check out what's popular, and then rank what they want to 
work on. The system then uses a smart algorithm to match students to projects, looking at their 
preferences, grades, and how many spots are open in each project. 
 
Phase 3: Results and Management 
Students see their approved matches, along with supervisor contact information, and teachers 
get their student lists. Administrators handle special situations by assigning matches manually 
and keeping projects on track using deadlines. 
 
The interface design works well for everyone involved because it gives them the right tools for 
their roles, keeps things organized, and is designed to be easy to use [9]. It mixes automated 
tasks  with  admin  controls.  Therefore,  work  is  shared  fairly,  but  there  remains  flexibility  to  
handle special cases. 
 
3.3
 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION UPDATES 
This subsection summarizes the main design refinements and implementation decisions made 
after the initial proposal. It focuses on how the actual system differs from, or extends beyond, 
the original plan. 
3.3.1 TECH STACK IMPROVEMENTS 
In  Section  2  mentioned,  why  the  MERN  stack  has  been  chosen.  Since  then,  some  specific  
improvements to make development easier, keep things organized, and boost how well it runs. 
 
Table  X  shows  a  comparison  between  the  original  high-level  design  and  the  implemented  
solution: 
COMPONENT ORIGINAL DESIGN IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION 
Frontend framework React (generic) 
React 18 with Vite 5, 
providing a faster 
development server, 
optimized builds, and a 
modern tooling ecosystem. 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 21 
Styling approach Inline styles / global CSS 
Modular CSS with per-
component stylesheets, 
improving maintainability 
and reducing style conflicts 
across pages. 
State management Not explicitly specified 
React Hooks (including 
useState, useEffect, and 
useMemo) for reactive state 
management and 
performance optimisation. 
Routing Not explicitly specified 
React Router DOM v6 with 
role-based protected routes 
for Students, Supervisors, 
and Administrators. 
Table 3 
These improvements keep the original three-tier setup but make the code easier to change and 
add to. 
 
3.3.2 USER INTERFACE UPDATES 
The user interfaces are close to the original designs shown in Section 3.1, but several usability 
updates have been introduced to make the system easier to use. 
 
3.3.2.1 DRAG-AND-DROP FOR RANKING CHOICES 
The first design showed ranking project options as a simple list. Now, students can rank their 
choices  by  dragging  and  dropping  them  in  the  order  they  want. This  change  makes  ranking  
simpler and helps to avoid mistakes that could happen when students reorder with buttons. 
 
3.3.2.2 PROJECT FILTERING   
The project search tool is improved to help students pick the right projects. Here's what's new, 
find  projects  by  searching  keywords  in  the  title,  description,  or  supervisor's  name.  Filter  by  
skills needed, using tags pulled from listed required skills for each project. Choose projects by 
supervisor using a dropdown list. And, Sort projects by popularity, title, or supervisor's name. 
These updates give students more info and options when choosing their FYP projects. 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 22 
 
3.3.3 MATCHING ALGORITHM ENHANCEMENTS 
The first plan was to use a basic, straightforward method based on matching ideas. This would 
mainly use student choices and grades. Now, this idea is a Gale-Shapley-style system but with 
extra limits and ways to settle ties. 
 
Here's what the updated algorithm does:   
• GPA tie-breaker: If more than one student wants the same project, pick the one with 
the better GPA. It's a clear and simple way to decide. 
• Project  capacity  limits:  Set  a  limit  on  how  many  students  can  work  on  each  project.  
This keeps things manageable. 
• Preference limits: Students can list up to 10 project choices, ranked in order. This keeps 
the system from getting bogged down and helps students focus. 
• Popularity tracking: keep tracking of how many students want each project, updating 
the counts as students make their choices. 
This information shows up in the Student portal. These updates make the whole process fairer 
and easier to understand, while still sticking to the original plan. 
 
3.3.4 Data Export Functionality 
Some CSV export options are being added on the server. This makes it easier to keep records, 
create reports, and do other analysis. The data can export out of the system.

4. EXPERIMENT 
 
4.1 SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW 
The  current  prototype  has  been  implemented  using  React  18  with  Vite  on  the  frontend  and  
Node.js/Express with MongoDB on the backend. The main setup, login system, and Student 
portal  have  been  completed  according  to  the  original  plan.  Role-based  portals  for  students, 
supervisors,  and  administrators  have  been  set  up  and  are  running  in  a  local  development  
environment. The Teacher and Admin portals currently provide their main pages and layouts, 
with further backend integration planned. 
 
4.2 MATCHING ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION 
In the current implementation, the matching algorithm is based on a Gale–Shapley-style design 
with additional constraints.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
5.1 PROJECT STATUS AND ACHIEVED MILESTONES 
The  project  started  with  stages  for  system  setup,  portal  design,  algorithm  development,  and  
testing.  As  of  this  report,  the  initial  setup,  login  mechanism,  and  basic  Student  portal  have  
largely  been  completed  according  to  schedule.  The  matching  algorithm  has  also  been  
implemented slightly earlier than planned. In contrast, the Teacher and Admin portals are still 
in  progress  and  require  additional  backend  work.  Data  visualization,  systematic  testing,  and  
deployment preparation have not yet started and are planned for the next phase. Overall, the 
core functionality is in place, but further development is required before the system is ready 
for real-world use.

6. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
6.1 CONCLUSION 
This report has described the motivation, design, and current implementation status of the FYP 
Matching System. The main goal of the project – to provide a clear, centralized online platform 
for Final Year Project allocation – remains unchanged. A role-based web application has been 
created with dedicated areas for students, supervisors, and administrative staff. The enhanced 
matching process can now assign students to projects based on their stated preferences, GPA, 
and  project  capacity  limits.  Although  the  system  is  not  yet  ready  for  deployment,  the  work  
completed so far shows that the planned design is technically feasible and consistent with the 
original  objectives.  The  remaining  work  mainly  focuses  on  improving  usability,  completing  
portal integration, and strengthening reliability, rather than changing the core architecture. 
 
6.2 DATA DISPLAY AND BASIC ANALYSIS 
Currently,  the  system  offers  simple  numbers,  like  how  popular  a  project  is,  to  help  students  
make choices. Next, a straightforward visual can give users a clearer idea of the project choices. 
Planned improvements include: 
6. A small stats area showing the total number of students, projects, and students matched 
to projects.  
7. Simple charts to show how popular projects are (like a bar chart showing how many 
students picked each project).  
8. Simple summaries for administrators, like the number of students not matched and how 
full each project is.  
These visuals will be added using simple chart tools that work with the current React setup, 
without changing how the system matches students to projects.  
 
6.3 NOTIFICATION AND ANNOUNCEMENT CENTER 
Inside the Application Right now, people have to refresh pages to get updates on project status. 
To reduce any confusion, a notification center should be added inside the application.  
Planned improvements include: 
• Each  portal  will  have  a  notification  area  for  system  messages  (like  phase  changes,  
project approvals, or updated deadlines). 
• Each person will have a simple inbox showing read and unread messages. 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 28 
• Icons will tell users when they have new notifications. 
All notifications will be in the web application, so external emails won’t be used. This keeps 
things simple. 
 
6.4 IMPROVEMENTS TO TEACHER AND ADMIN PORTALS 
The existing Teacher and Admin portals show the main pages and layouts, but some processes 
are  still  basic  or  not  fully  finished.  Completing  and  refining  these  key  processes  instead  of  
introducing brand-new systems. 
 
For the Teacher portal, planned improvements are: 
• Finishing  project  management  functions  (creating,  editing,  and  archiving  projects  on  
the web). 
• Making  the  applicant  view  better  so  supervisors  can  easily  see  details  such  as  GPA,  
department, and preferred order. 
• Adding simple note or comment sections for supervisors to write remarks about their 
students or projects. 
 
For the Admin portal, planned improvements are: 
• Refining the project review process by adding status indicators (like pending, approved, 
or rejected). 
• Creating an easier way to manually assign students who have not been matched. 
• Making  the  deadline  management  easier  to  use,  so  it  is  simpler  to  set  up  and  check  
phase start and end times. 
 
These  changes  will  improve  the  portals  and  make  them  more  user-friendly,  without  adding  
much complexity to the system. 
 
6.5 USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS AND USER FEEDBACK 
While the current interfaces work, not all usability aspects have been checked with actual users. 
Future work will involve small improvements based on user feedback. 
 
Planned actions include: 

ELEC S411F (2025/26) Proposal  Page 29 
• Hold  user  feedback  sessions  with  a  small  group  of  students,  supervisors,  and  
administrators to find confusing workflows or missing details. 
• Improve form layouts, labels, and error messages to avoid wrong input and make each 
step clearer. 
• Add  help  (like  tooltips  or  short  explanations)  on  important  pages  like  the  preference  
submission and matching results screens. 
 
These changes focus on making the system simpler to learn and use, mainly for new users. 
 
6.6 BASIC TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION 
So  far,  testing  has  mainly  been  carried  out  manually  during  development.  To  increase  
confidence in the stability of the system, a modest amount of structured testing and deployment 
preparation is planned. 
 
Planned improvements include: 
• Adding a few unit tests for important backend parts, like the matching system and key 
API points. 
• Run simple load tests for common busy times. For example, when many students send 
in or change their choices close to the deadline. 
• Get the system ready to launch on a test server, setting up the basics for a final version 
and environment settings. 
 
These steps should make things more reliable without needing a fully automated or huge setup.
